ACE Wealth Partners is a successful Registered Investment Advisor in the State of Colorado that needed a new website to reflect the new direction in their business model.

Working with Art Director Jon Lambert at Brand Iron, we rebuilt their web presence to speak to the audiences they target: Academic, Community and Entrepreneurs (ACE).

### Challenge

We looked at the new goals of ACE Wealth Partners and worked to make sure those were specifically addressed. The new business model called for to achieving three specific goals:

- Create a new brand
- Target the Academic, Community and Entrepreneurs markets
- Make contacting ACE as easy as possible for the visitor

### Integration

The client has been a successful blogger for a number of years, the only catch was that their content was distributed across two different platforms. We worked with Kevin McNab, the founder of ACE Wealth Partners, to bring his great content under one roof.

### Solution

ACE Wealth Partners has a new site that speaks directly to the markets they serve. Contacting Kevin and his team is given extra emphasis.  Of course, the new site is mobile-friendly and ready for phones and tablets.

### Project Involvement

- Front-end Development
- WordPress CMS Integration
- Maintenance
- Security
- Email Migration
